# Party Shuffle

A component for [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/) player.
Adds a Party Shuffle mode, a similar feature like iTunes or Android Music Player have.

## Usage

There is a menu item *Playback* â†’ *Party Shuffle* which turns on/off the feature.

If this feature is turned on then random tracks will be added to the current playlist when the last track has just finished playing so the next track will continue playing.

If *Stop after current* is on in this case then only new tracks will be added and a playback will be stopped.
